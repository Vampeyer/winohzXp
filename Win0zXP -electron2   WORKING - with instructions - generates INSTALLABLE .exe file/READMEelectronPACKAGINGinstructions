 ELECTRON PACKAGER - 
 HOW TO PACKAGE AN ELECTRON APP , 
 INTO A .EXE FILE. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Turning a web page into a executable local file , 
using electron. 

install electron through npm as such , 

  0 . npm init -y

  1.   npm i electron-packager 

  2. Make a command in package.json  file ,
  add , 
   
   "start": "electron .",
   
    "build": "electron-packager ."

    , in the scripts column , directly after the comma after the start script , or the test script. 


3.  Then , in the terminal  console type -    npm i electron  


4. run , npm run build.    

the package will now be in a exe file , for me , 
it was in this folder .
